# Logistic Regression using PCA
## Overview
In this project we show how PCA can be used in Logistic Regression. Using PCA on the datasets, allows us to projects it onto a lower-dimensional subspace, effectively filtering out noise. As a result, we are easily able to find boundaries that separate the classes

## Requirements
Python 3.x Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, 4090Ti
